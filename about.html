            <h2>---My Philosophy of what it means to be an engineer---<br></h2>
            <p>I believe engineering has deeper significance. A sense of curiosity for the world around them permeates engineers. To be an engineer means to understand that everything in the outside world has a mechanical and mathematical foundation. I think engineers acknowledge that they can use the tools of quantitative analysis to comprehend and model our world. They observe the relationships and interactions between science and engineering, as well as how advancements in one field influence those in the other.
                Perhaps the ability to address urgent global issues with energy, sustainability, transportation, education, healthcare, food, and the environment is what engineers are most aware of. Engineers eventually want to create a new reality that is a better environment for everyone, whereas other basic science fields seek to understand reality.</p>
